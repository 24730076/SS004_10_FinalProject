# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game implemented in C++.

## Features

- Move the snake using `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys.
- Eat food to grow the snake and increase the score.
- The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.
- The game area is outlined with a border.

## Requirements

- C++14 compatible compiler
- Windows OS (due to the use of Windows-specific functions like `Sleep` and `_kbhit`)
